## Part 2 ##

1. I find style 2, that is logging into ssh and make the edits using Vim, and run ```
bash test.sh```
is better if I was running remotely, because it's faster since I don't have to open the folder in the local machine to make edits, 

2. A factor that's may influence my decision into choosing style 1 rather than 2, is that when I'd like for there to be codes that's already available on my local machine, and it's better if i want to make edits over a period of time than going in and out of vim, as well as saving as exiting the file .
